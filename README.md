This summer internship position will be exploring new diagnostic tools
for users to visualize time series information of 3D Spatial data using
Python. Currently all of are scripts are written in Matlab, and we would
are aiming to create a suite of diagnostic tools that are easy for users
to integrate into their own work flow, and make plots that are intuitive
and comprehensive.

![EnKF](./data/AssimAnim.jpg)


The typical set-up is a "twin experiment", where you
* specify a
  * dynamic model* 
  * observational model*
* use these to generate a synthetic
  * "truth"
  * and observations thereof*
* assess how different DA methods perform in estimating the truth,
    given the above starred (*) items.

Installation
------------------------------------------------
Prerequisite: `python3.5+` with
`scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`.
This is all comes with [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
by default.

For the tutorials, you will also need
`jupyter` and the `markdown` package.

It is also recommended to install `tqdm` (e.g. `pip install tqdm`).

Additional features
------------------------------------------------
Many
* Visualizations 
* Diagnostics
* Tools to manage and display experimental settings and stats

<!--

Also has:
* Live plotting with on/off toggle
* Confidence interval on times series (e.g. rmse) with
  * automatic correction for autocorrelation 
  * significant digits printing
* CovMat class (input flexibility/overloading, lazy eval) that facilitates
    the use of non-diagnoal covariance matrices (whether sparse or full)
* Intelligent defaults (e.g. plot duration estimated from autocorrelation,
    axis limits estimated from percentiles)
* Chronology/Ticker with consistency checks
* Gentle failure system to allow execution to continue if experiment fails.
* Progressbar
* Multivariate random variables: Gaussian, Student-t, Laplace, Uniform, ...,
    as well as support for custom sampling functions.
* X-platform random number generator (for debugging accross platforms)
* Parallelisation options
    * Forecast parallelisation is possible since
        the (user-implemented) model has access to the full ensemble
        (see `mods/QG/core.py`)
    * A light-weight alternative (see e.g. `mods/Lorenz95/core.py`):
        native numpy vectorization (again by having access to full ensemble).
    * (Independent) experiments can also run in parallel.
        Auto-config provided by `utils.py:parallelize()`.

-->

What it can't do
------------------------------------------------

<!--
* Do highly efficient DA on very big models (see discussion in introdution).
* Run different DA methods concurrently (i.e. step-by-step)
     allowing for live/online  (graphic or text) comparison.
* Time-dependent error coviariances and changes in lengths of state/obs
     (but f and h may otherwise depend on time).
* Non-uniform time sequences only partially supported.
-->



How to
------------------------------------------------
**Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks**
The process of getting jupyter notebooks to run on your computer can be done multiple ways, but I think the easiest method is simply installing the Anaconda3 (python 3.7) package onto your system, as the package includes a lot of python packages that are useful for graphing and mathematics. 
Start by in your web browser finding the download for Anaconda3 (python 3.7) for your OS, and install it onto your local system
Now when you CD into the SiParCS directory, you should simply be able to run the commmand, 

$ jupyter notebook

This will open up the jupyter webrowser to start creating/editing/running jupyter notebooks .
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
The above URL is a great resource for information on the installation of Jupyter, I'd reccomend looking over it.

**Setting up with Password requirement**
If you'd like to set up a password that is required everytime you start running the command "jupyter notebook", you can simply in your terminal run the command, 

$ jupyter notebook password

This will prompt you to create and confirm a password that will be required everytime you try to access your notebooks.

**Presentations using Jupyter Notebooks**
Jupyter allows you to present your cells in a interactive presentation format.  To install the conda packages that allows this feature, just run this line in your terminal window:

$ conda install -c damianavila82 rise

a really good resource on how to manipulate and format the order of the slides can be found in the link below.
